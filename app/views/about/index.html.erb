Four Seasons of Code or, FSoC is a project tracking and management application.

Let's repeat that again.

Four Seasons of Code or, FSoC is a project tracking and management application.

There are number of fine project management tools available in the
Free and Open Source Software space. FSoC is not intended to be
another like them. The idea behind FSoC has been very simple - it
should allow any organization or, group setting up an ad-hoc bounty
or, code-sprint the ability to track the individual projects.

Our ideal user is a group that is handling intern projects or, a
collective which is interested in offering a bounty like program.
Keeping it simple from the end-user and the organizer perspective has
been the mantra of FSoC development.

The lifecycle of such ad-hoc projects are simple. They are conceived
by a mentor, the proposal is drawn up by a candidate, the mentor and
the candidate then collaborate to set up the tasks, milestones and so
forth. A forward momentum is generated within the project idea and, at
the end of the cycle the mentor checks that deliverables have been
achieved and timelines have been adhered to. This leads to the
sign-off for the project and everything is just fine.

That is exactly what FSoC aims to deliver. Nothing less. Keeping it
simple is a beautiful game. The FSoC development team is learning the
rules of it through continuous improvement
